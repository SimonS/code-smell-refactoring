# Introduction to Code Smells and Refactoring Techniques

Each folder contains a small example that highlights a particular code smell. There are tests included to make sure you don't break anything while refactoring.

The `assault_course` is a slightly larger example that combines various code smells and can be used to test out your refactoring chops.

For instructions on how to run the tests for a given smell, see the `README` in each folder.
